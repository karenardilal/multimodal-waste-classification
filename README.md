ENEN 645 Assignment 2 Repo: multimodal garbage classification combining image features with filename text information, trained and evaluated on TALC.

This project implements a multimodal deep learning pipeline for 4-class waste classification (Black, Blue, Green, TTR) with a strong emphasis on coding practices that improve robustness, reproducibility, and evaluation integrity. The data is transformed using several methods of data augmentation. The architecture uses a two-branch design: a pretrained ResNet50 image backbone and a TF-IDF–based text branch derived from filenames. Critically, the TF-IDF vectorizer is fit on the training set only to prevent data leakage, and validation/test splits remain untouched throughout preprocessing. The training loop incorporates a two-stage transfer learning strategy (initial backbone freezing followed by selective fine-tuning with discriminative learning rates), which stabilizes convergence and protects pretrained features from early corruption. Class imbalance is handled explicitly using a "Weighted Random Sampler" applied only to the training loader, while evaluation emphasizes balanced accuracy and macro F1 to ensure fair performance across minority classes. Additional robustness measures include AdamW for decoupled weight decay, early stopping and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduling based on validation balanced accuracy, clean checkpointing of the best model, controlled GPU execution settings for cluster stability, and automated generation of confusion matrices and misclassification grids for systematic error analysis.

The final model achieves strong and well-balanced test performance (≈0.86 accuracy, ≈0.85 balanced accuracy, ≈0.86 macro F1), with particularly strong performance on the Green class and moderate confusion between visually similar categories such as Black and Blue. Overall, the results demonstrate that the careful engineering choices in training control, data handling, and evaluation design meaningfully contribute to stable and reliable multimodal performance.
